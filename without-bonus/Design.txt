Implementation--->


The SimpleLoader is designed to load and execute ELF files using the C programming language. It consists of the following main components:

    loader.h: This header file defines the necessary data structures and functions for the loader.

    loader.c: This source file contains the implementation of the loader, including memory allocation, program header processing, memory mapping, and execution.

Loader Functions
void load_and_run_elf(char **exe)

This function is responsible for loading and executing the ELF file. It follows these steps:

   --> Open the ELF file specified as a command-line argument.
   --> Read the ELF header to retrieve necessary information.
   --> Allocate memory for the ELF header and program headers.
   --> Read the program headers.
   --> Iterate through the program headers and load the loadable segments into memory using mmap.
   --> Call the entry point of the loaded ELF program.
   --> Print the result obtained from the ELF program execution.

Cleanup function--> It Cleanup the memory.
